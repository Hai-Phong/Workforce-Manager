27/5: UI design for searching employee complete
30/5: complete UI design for pushing data into the database through form
30/5_update2: 
- after prompting deepseek to fix the code, register page now have a new design & DOB section with dropdown calendar
- complete homescreen (after login), the stats are still static tho, need to implement pulling data from the database              
1/6: open a new branch in_dev_mode with codes for admin_login, employee_login
10/6: fall back on using copilot to help with UI design, update with both employee and admin functionality, specifically:
- admin: the ability to add employee, change employee's property, view employee list, view attendance rate of employee
- employee: change their own non-sensitive information, check in & check out, view other employee's info (non-sensitive)
